# Hi there! üëã I'm Pramoda Sahoo

### üöÄ Senior DevOps & Cloud Engineer | Platform Engineering Expert | Team Leader

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate DevOps engineer with **10+ years** of experience building and scaling cloud infrastructure. I love solving complex problems with simple, elegant solutions and helping development teams ship faster while maintaining rock-solid reliability.

## üéØ **What I Do Best**

I specialize in taking messy, manual processes and turning them into smooth, automated workflows that just work. My sweet spot is building infrastructure that developers actually enjoy using - the kind where deployments are boring (in the best possible way) and outages are rare.

**Some highlights of what I've accomplished:**
- Maintained **99.99% uptime** across multi-region systems serving millions of users
- Reduced deployment times from hours to minutes through smart automation
- Built self-service platforms that eliminated 90% of infrastructure tickets
- Led teams of 10+ engineers while keeping everyone happy and productive
- Achieved significant cost savings through intelligent resource optimization
- Maintained zero critical security vulnerabilities across all environments

## üõ†Ô∏è **My Technical Toolkit**

### ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Platforms**
![AWS](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-FF9900?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazon-aws&logoColor=white)
![Azure](https://img.shields.io/badge/Azure-0078D4?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-azure&logoColor=white)
![GCP](https://img.shields.io/badge/GCP-4285F4?style=for-the-badge&logo=google-cloud&logoColor=white)

I'm cloud-native by heart but platform-agnostic by choice. Whether it's AWS, Azure, or GCP, I focus on building solutions that make sense for your business, not just following the latest trends.

### üê≥ **Container Orchestration**
![Kubernetes](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kubernetes-326CE5?style=for-the-badge&logo=kubernetes&logoColor=white)
![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2496ED?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)
![OpenShift](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenShift-EE0000?style=for-the-badge&logo=red-hat-open-shift&logoColor=white)
![EKS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Amazon_EKS-FF9900?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazon-eks&logoColor=white)
![ECS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Amazon_ECS-FF9900?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazon-ecs&logoColor=white)

Kubernetes isn't just a tool for me - it's become second nature. I've managed clusters handling thousands of pods, orchestrated complex deployments, and yes, I've debugged those mysterious networking issues at 2 AM too.

### üîÑ **CI/CD & Automation**
![Jenkins](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jenkins-D24939?style=for-the-badge&logo=jenkins&logoColor=white)
![GitHub Actions](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub_Actions-2088FF?style=for-the-badge&logo=github-actions&logoColor=white)
![GitLab CI](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitLab_CI-FC6D26?style=for-the-badge&logo=gitlab&logoColor=white)
![ArgoCD](https://img.shields.io/badge/ArgoCD-EF7B4D?style=for-the-badge&logo=argo&logoColor=white)
![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/badge/CircleCI-343434?style=for-the-badge&logo=circleci&logoColor=white)

I believe in making deployments so reliable and automated that you can push to production on Friday afternoons without breaking into a cold sweat. I've managed hundreds of pipelines and built deployment strategies that just work.

### üèóÔ∏è **Infrastructure as Code**
![Terraform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Terraform-7B42BC?style=for-the-badge&logo=terraform&logoColor=white)
![Ansible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ansible-EE0000?style=for-the-badge&logo=ansible&logoColor=white)
![CloudFormation](https://img.shields.io/badge/CloudFormation-FF9900?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazon-aws&logoColor=white)
![Helm](https://img.shields.io/badge/Helm-0F1689?style=for-the-badge&logo=helm&logoColor=white)

"Click-ops" is a dirty word in my vocabulary. Everything should be in code, versioned, reviewed, and reproducible. I've automated infrastructure provisioning across multiple clouds and made complex deployments as simple as a git push.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Compliance**
![SonarQube](https://img.shields.io/badge/SonarQube-4E9BCD?style=for-the-badge&logo=sonarqube&logoColor=white)
![Trivy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Trivy-1904DA?style=for-the-badge&logo=trivy&logoColor=white)
![AWS WAF](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS_WAF-FF9900?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazon-aws&logoColor=white)
![Teleport](https://img.shields.io/badge/Teleport-512BD4?style=for-the-badge&logo=teleport&logoColor=white)

Security isn't something you bolt on at the end - it's baked into everything from day one. I've implemented zero-trust architectures, automated compliance workflows, and built systems that are secure by default, not by accident.

### üìä **Monitoring & Observability**
![Prometheus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Prometheus-E6522C?style=for-the-badge&logo=prometheus&logoColor=white)
![Grafana](https://img.shields.io/badge/Grafana-F46800?style=for-the-badge&logo=grafana&logoColor=white)
![Elasticsearch](https://img.shields.io/badge/Elasticsearch-005571?style=for-the-badge&logo=elasticsearch&logoColor=white)
![Kibana](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kibana-005571?style=for-the-badge&logo=kibana&logoColor=white)
![Jaeger](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jaeger-66CFE6?style=for-the-badge&logo=jaeger&logoColor=black)
![Splunk](https://img.shields.io/badge/Splunk-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=splunk&logoColor=white)

You can't improve what you can't measure. I build monitoring systems that tell you what's happening before your users notice something's wrong. Think beautiful dashboards, intelligent alerting, and those satisfying green lights that mean everything's running smoothly.

### üíª **Programming & Scripting**
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)
![Bash](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bash-4EAA25?style=for-the-badge&logo=gnu-bash&logoColor=white)
![YAML](https://img.shields.io/badge/YAML-CB171E?style=for-the-badge&logo=yaml&logoColor=white)
![JSON](https://img.shields.io/badge/JSON-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=json&logoColor=white)

I write code to eliminate repetitive work. Whether it's Python scripts for automation, Bash for system administration, or well-structured YAML for configuration, I believe in clean, maintainable code that others can actually understand.

## üí° **What Makes Me Different**

### üéØ **Platform Engineering Mindset**
I don't just build infrastructure - I build platforms that empower developers. Think of me as someone who creates the roads and bridges that let development teams race ahead without worrying about the underlying complexity.

- **Developer Experience First**: I create self-service platforms that make developers' lives easier
- **Golden Paths**: I establish clear, well-documented ways to do things right the first time
- **Automation Everything**: If you're doing it manually more than twice, I'll automate it

### üîê **Security Without Friction**
Security doesn't have to slow you down. I integrate security practices seamlessly into development workflows, so teams can move fast while staying safe.

- **Shift-Left Security**: Catch issues before they reach production
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify - but make it invisible to users
- **Compliance Automation**: Turn audits from nightmares into non-events

### üìà **Business-Minded Engineering**
I understand that technology serves business goals. Every architectural decision I make considers cost, scalability, maintainability, and business impact.

- **Cost Optimization**: I've saved organizations significant money through smart resource management
- **Scalability Planning**: Building systems that grow with your business, not against it
- **Risk Management**: Balancing innovation with stability and reliability

## üîÆ **Staying Ahead of the Curve**

The technology landscape never stops evolving, and neither do I. Here's what I'm excited about:

### ü§ñ **AI & Automation**
I'm exploring how machine learning can make infrastructure even smarter - from predictive scaling to automated incident response. The goal isn't to replace human judgment but to augment it.

### üå± **Sustainable Engineering**
Green computing isn't just good for the planet - it's good for business. I'm implementing practices that optimize for both performance and environmental impact.

### üîß **Platform Engineering Evolution**
The future of DevOps is about building internal platforms that feel like magic to developers. I'm always learning about new ways to reduce cognitive load and increase developer velocity.
